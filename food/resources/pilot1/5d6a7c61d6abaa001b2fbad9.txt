hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner
Sure. I think I'll follow your lead and have something light too. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
very healthy
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have some time
Great! I love spending time cooking myself. What about Mango Spinach Green Smoothie? This meal contains baby spinach leaves which is great if you want to eat healthy and have time to cook.
it looks great
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no I like to use this one
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
