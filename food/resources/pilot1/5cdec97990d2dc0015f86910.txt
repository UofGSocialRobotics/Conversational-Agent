HELLO
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
YS ALL GOOD
Lovely! As a robot, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
LIGHT DINNER
Yeah robots are never hungry either. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
QUITE
Sure! For you humans, health is the real wealth, you're a smart person! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
NO
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
TIME
Great! Robots like me can't cook, but it definitely seems fun to spend time cooking. What about Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper? This meal contains broccoli which is great if you have time to cook.
NO
I though you would like it. Humans are such a mystery to me. Give me another chance. What about Sweet and Tangy Tuna Stuffed Peppers? It contains light tuna, which seems perfect for you!
POSSIBLY
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
YES
 If you like butternut squash, how about Roasted Red Pepper Butternut Squash Noodles with Chicken?
NO
I though you would like it. Humans are such a mystery to me. Give me another chance. Red bell peppers would work perfectly for you if you have time to cook, so how about Quinoa-Stuffed Peppers?
YES
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
YES
 chilies would work perfectly for you if you have time to cook, so how about How to Make Pickled Peppers?
NO
I'm sorry I can't find anything that correspond to your criteria. I had more success with the 856 other people I recommended recipe to in the last hour. Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
