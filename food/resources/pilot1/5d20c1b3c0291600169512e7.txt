hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes im good
Lovely! As a robot, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
i am hungry
I don't know what it feels like to be hungry, but I'll remember to find something filling for you! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
quite healthy
Sure! For you humans, health is the real wealth, you're a smart person! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
i am vegetarian
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
something quick
Of course. Main advantage of being a robot: I have all the time in the world! Lime would work perfectly for you if you feel hungry, want to eat healthy, are vegan and don't have much time to cook, so how about Chipotle Lime Grilled Shrimp Salad in Cilantro Lime Dressing?
i dont like that
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
yes please
 What about Brussel Sprouts Salad with Orange Ginger Dressing? This meal contains brussel sprouts which is great if you feel hungry, want to eat healthy, are vegan and don't have much time to cook.
i like that
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no thank you
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
