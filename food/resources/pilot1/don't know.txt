hi
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Hello
Lovely! As a robot, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
What's dinner?
Yeah robots are never hungry either. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
