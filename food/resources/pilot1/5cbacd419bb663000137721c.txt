Hi
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
fine thank
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
hungry
I'm hungry too! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
very healthy and vegetarian or fish
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
vegetarian
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
have time
Great! I love spending time cooking myself. What about Chipotle Lime Grilled Shrimp Salad in Cilantro Lime Dressing? This meal contains lime which is great if you feel hungry, want to eat healthy, are vegan and have time to cook.
I don't eat shrimp
Really? It's one of my favorites, but I can recommend something else. What about Brussel Sprouts Salad with Orange Ginger Dressing? It contains brussel sprouts, which seems perfect for you!
I don't eat brusell sprouts sorry
Really? I think it's good. Give me another chance. Avocado chickpea salad (and a giveaway!) has avocado in it, I think you should like it.
very nice, yes
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
yes
 If you like tabasco sauce, how about Mexican Salad with Lime Dressing?
yes good
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
yes
 Spinach Strawberry Salad with Strawberry Vinaigrette has baby spinach in it, I think you should like it.
no thanks
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
