hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
i'm feeling hungry
I'm hungry too! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
healthy
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
Of course, you're a busy person, I know how precious time is. What about Poached Salmon? This meal contains salmon fillets which is great if you feel hungry, want to eat healthy and don't have much time to cook.
i don't like fish
Really? It's one of my favorites, but I can recommend something else. Simple Herb Crusted Salmon has salmon fillets in it, I think you should like it.
i don't like salmon
Oh we must have very different tastes then. Let me find something else. Shelby's Take on the Bacon, Egg and Cheese has cheese in it, I think you should like it.
i like it
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
