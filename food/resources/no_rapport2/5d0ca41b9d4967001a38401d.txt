Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'd rather have a light dinner
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Really healthy
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
none
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Rather quick to prepare
 Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
Thanks
 Would you like another recipe?
No
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
