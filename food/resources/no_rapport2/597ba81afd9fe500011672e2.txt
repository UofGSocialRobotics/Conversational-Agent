Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm hungry
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
not necesserily 
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I don't eat nuts and almonds
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
not much
 If you like kale, how about African Kale & Yam Soup?
Can you offer something else?
 Would you like another recipe?
well yeah
 What about 15-Minute Miso Soup with Greens and Tofu? It contains tofu, which seems perfect for you!
I don't have tofu
 If you like broccoli, how about Creamy Broccoli Spinach Soup | A Bowl of Green?

 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
