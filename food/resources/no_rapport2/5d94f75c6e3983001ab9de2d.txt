Hi
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
mostly
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
 Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
thank you
 Would you like another recipe?
no
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
