Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm feeling hungry
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Pretty healthy I'd say
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I am a vegetarian
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
hm... I'd rather have something quick I think
 African Kale & Yam Soup has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
unfortunately I don't have miso paste at home
 If you like tofu, how about 15-Minute Miso Soup with Greens and Tofu?
that looks nice
 Would you like another recipe?
yes please
 What about {38 Power Foods} Chilled Asparagus Soup with Spinach and Avocado? It contains asparagus, which seems perfect for you!
yes, it does!
 Would you like another recipe?
do you have anything with courgettes?
 If you like green beans, how about Detox Green Machine Soup?
I am not so much into celery
 Southwestern Three-Bean & Barley Soup Mix has pearl barley in it, hopefully you will like it.
