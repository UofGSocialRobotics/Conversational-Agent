Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
reasonably
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
none
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
 What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
where's the beef?
 Would you like another recipe?
How about something with some meat?
 Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
I'm not a vegetarian
 What about Tomato, Onion, Avocado Salad? It contains bell pepper, which seems perfect for you!
I just told you, I don't want to eat a salad
 Sauteed Spinach with Bacon and Onions has baby spinach in it, hopefully you will like it.
That's more like it.
 Would you like another recipe?
If you must
 If you like avocado, how about Massaged Kale Salad with Avocado and Pickled Red Onions?
How about you stick that recipe where the sun doesn't shine?
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
