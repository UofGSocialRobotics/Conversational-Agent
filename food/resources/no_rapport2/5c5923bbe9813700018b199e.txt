hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner, please
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
healthy, but also tasty
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I am allergic to tree nuts and most seeds.
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick is best
 If you like kale, how about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad?
that sounds good
 Would you like another recipe?
yes
 Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
thank you
 Would you like another recipe?
no
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
