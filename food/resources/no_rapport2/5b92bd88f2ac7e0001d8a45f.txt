Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm feeling hungry
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Pretty healthy
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nope
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time
 If you like broccoli slaw, how about Easy Kale & Broccoli Slaw Rice Bowl with a Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce â€¦and Fave Five Friday: Kale?
Sounds good
 Would you like another recipe?
No thanks, this looks great
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
