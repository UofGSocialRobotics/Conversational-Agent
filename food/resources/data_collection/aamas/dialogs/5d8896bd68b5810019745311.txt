Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Catherine
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, everything is alright! Thank you.
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Belgium, in the province of Antwerp.
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
A lot of vegetables, mostly vegetarian or vegan. Quite often we eat some cooked and raw vegetables alongside some rice or potatoes.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm quite hungry.
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
I like it when it's very healthy.
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No milk, eggs, meat or fish. I'd prefer it to be vegan.
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
If it could be quick, that would be nice.
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like salmon fillets, how about Poached Salmon?
I asked to give me a recipe without fish, so I'm afraid this isn't an option.
Let me find something else. If you like avocado, how about Avocado chickpea salad (and a giveaway!)?
Yes, that's better!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes, one more would be nice.
 Chopped Kale Salad with Pomegranate & Avocado has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
Yes, this looks really good. Thank you!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No, this is fine.
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
