Hallo!
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Ieva
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, everything is fine. How about You?
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
Latvia
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Chicken with rice, soup, potatoes with some kind of meeat
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
A light dinner
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Not too healthy
Ya, taste first and healthiness second right?  Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  Avocado With Bell Pepper And Tomatoes has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
Love avocado
Okay. What about Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper? It contains broccoli, which seems perfect for you!
Can I have something with chicken in it?
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes
 If you like light tuna, how about Sweet and Tangy Tuna Stuffed Peppers?
I don't know if I would like this
Give me another chance. What about Spinach Artichoke Hummus with Shamrock Shaped Green Peppers? It contains green bell peppers, which seems perfect for you!
No
Let me find something else. How to Make Pickled Peppers has garlic in it, hopefully you will like it.
Not really something i would eat for dinner! Something with chicken please!
I can't find anything else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
