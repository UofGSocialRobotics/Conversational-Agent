hi
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
i'm fine thanks
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
i would rather have a light dinner
Sure. I think I'll follow your lead and have something light too. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
a little
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no i don't have any specific diet
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
i would something quick
Of course, you're a busy person, I know how precious time is. What about Avocado With Bell Pepper And Tomatoes? This meal contains avocado which is great if you don't have much time to cook.
sounds great 
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no thanks
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
