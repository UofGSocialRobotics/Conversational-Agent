hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes everything is alright
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I rather have a light dinner
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
very healthy
Sure! Health is the real wealth, you're a smart person! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no I don't have any allergies or intolerances
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I only have 20 minutes
Great! Cooking can be so much fun when you have time for it! What about Mango Spinach Green Smoothie? It contains baby spinach leaves, which seems perfect for you!
thank you 
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no need to thank you
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
