Hallo
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?

 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
a lot
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
none
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
something fast
 If you like great northern beans, how about Italian Style Rice And Beans?
great
 Would you like another recipe?
no thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
