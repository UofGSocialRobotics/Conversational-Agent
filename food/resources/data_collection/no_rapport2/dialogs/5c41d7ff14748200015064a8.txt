hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?

 How healthy do you want your meal to be?

 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?

 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?

 What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!

 Would you like another recipe?

 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
