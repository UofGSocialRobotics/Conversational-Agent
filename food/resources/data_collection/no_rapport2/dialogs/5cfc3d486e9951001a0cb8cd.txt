Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?

 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Fairly healthy
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
None
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Quick
 Creamy Broccoli-white Bean Soup has chicken stock in it, hopefully you will like it.

 Would you like another recipe?

 What about African Kale & Yam Soup? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!

 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
