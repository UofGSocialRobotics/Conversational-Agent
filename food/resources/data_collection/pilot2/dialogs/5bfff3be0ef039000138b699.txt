Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Nadia
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Sure, what about you?
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
the Netherlands
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Vegetables, potatoes, pasta
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Very healthy
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Apples and nuts
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Poached Salmon? It contains salmon fillets, which seems perfect for you!
That would be nice, but I'm more hungry than that. And it's pretty expensive...'
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes
 Simple Herb Crusted Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
Nice thank you, still a pretty expensive recipe
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes
 What about Maple Glazed Salmon? It contains maple syrup, which seems perfect for you!
Can you give me something other than salmon please
Okay. Whole30 grilled salmon with avocado salsa has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
This is still salmon
Okay. What about Baked Mustard-Crusted Salmon With Asparagus and Tarragon? It contains asparagus, which seems perfect for you!
Come on...
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
