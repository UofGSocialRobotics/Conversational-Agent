hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
sofia
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes fine
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
london
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
pasta or rice with vegetables
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
not very
Ya, taste first and healthiness second right?  Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Creamy Broccoli-white Bean Soup? It contains canned cannellini beans, which seems perfect for you!
i don't like that
I have something else for you. If you like kale, how about African Kale & Yam Soup?
no i don't like that
Let me find something else. What about Creamy Broccoli Spinach Soup | A Bowl of Green? It contains broccoli, which seems perfect for you!

Let me find something else. If you like butternut squash, how about Apple Butternut Squash Soup?
