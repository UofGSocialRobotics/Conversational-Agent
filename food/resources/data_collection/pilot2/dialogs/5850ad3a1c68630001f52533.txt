hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Jason
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes fine, thanks.
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
England
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Pasta and chicken
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
A little healthy
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick to prepare
Of course, you're a busy person.  Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper has broccoli in it, hopefully you will like it.
thanks
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
no thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
