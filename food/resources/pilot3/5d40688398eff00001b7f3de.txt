hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Vitor
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, pretty much!
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
London
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Rice with chicken and beans or tuna...
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light dinner
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
A bit healthy
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nope.
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper? It contains broccoli, which seems perfect for you!
No. I hate broccoli
I have something else for you. What about Mango Spinach Green Smoothie? It contains baby spinach leaves, which seems perfect for you!
No
I have something else for you. If you like baby spinach, how about Spinach Strawberry Salad with Strawberry Vinaigrette?
I don't like spinach
Give me another chance. What about Quinoa Kale Tomato Corn Salad {Video + Giveaway}? It contains cooked quinoa, which seems perfect for you!
No.
I have something else for you. If you like sun dried tomato, how about Three Color Pasta with Sun Dried Tomato Sauce?
Yes.
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
