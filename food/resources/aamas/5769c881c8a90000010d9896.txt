Hi Cora
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
My name is Jamie, I hope you can help me.
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm fine, a little bit hungry though.
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Scotland.
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
I usually eat a mix of some kind of meat (usually beef or chicken) with sweet potato and broccoli.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Feeling very hungry at the moment.
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
I would say moderately healthy but satisfying at the same time
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nope.
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time to cook.
Great! Simple Herb Crusted Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
Thank you for this recipe it seems quite simple to make!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
That's all for me
 If you like maple syrup, how about Maple Glazed Salmon?
I fear that this will be too sweet as a meal I prefer savoury when it comes to meals.
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
OK
 Salmon and Summer Veggies in Foil has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
Seems very healthy and warm.
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
