Hello
 Hi there! My name is Cora. I've been  working with a team of researchers on eating behaviors for a few months now, and I'm here to help you change your dinner habits. So tell me, what's your name?
Geoff
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm ok thanks, you?
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. I'd like us to know each other a bit better. I've just moved to Glasgow, Scotland a few months ago, I used to live in Pittsburgh, USA before that. It's raining a lot but I like it here. Can you tell me where you live?
Liverpool
What a coincidence! I spent some time there on vacation a few years ago. I loved that place! Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Pasta and sauces
I see. When I was young, my mom used to prepare various types of food. Now I try to have light and healthy dinners with lots of vegetables. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Very hungry
I'm hungry too! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
I don't mind as long as it tastes good
Ya, taste first and healthiness second right? I enjoy so much having a good dinner, I totally agree with you. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No fish
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person. Same here, I only have time to cook on weekends. What about Italian Style Rice And Beans? It contains great northern beans, which seems perfect for you!
Sounds good, can I add any meat to it?
I'm happy you like it. If you like cooked rice, how about Italian Rice?
Excellent, sounds lovely
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
No thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
