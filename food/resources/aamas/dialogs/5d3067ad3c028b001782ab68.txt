Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Patrick
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yup, everything's great.
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Warsaw, Poland.
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Chicken or some kind of pasta.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Moderately.
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No.
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time.
Great! If you like butternut squash, how about Butternut Squash Soup?
Maybe something else
Let me find something else. What about Creamy Broccoli Spinach Soup | A Bowl of Green? It contains broccoli, which seems perfect for you!
Anything else?
Let me find something else. What about Chicken Tortilla Soup? It contains chicken stock, which seems perfect for you!
That sounds good.
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Sure
 Cleansing Detox Soup has purple cabbage in it, hopefully you will like it.
It's worth a try.
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes.
 If you like dried fava beans, how about Mexican Fava Bean Soup (Sopa de Habas)?
Something else
I can't find anything else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
