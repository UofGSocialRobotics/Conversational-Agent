hello Cora
 Hi there! My name is Cora. I've been  working with a team of researchers on eating behaviors for a few months now, and I'm here to help you change your dinner habits. So tell me, what's your name?
Jane
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
perfect
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. I'd like us to know each other a bit better. I've just moved to Glasgow, Scotland a few months ago, I used to live in Pittsburgh, USA before that. It's raining a lot but I like it here. Can you tell me where you live?
The Netherlands
What a coincidence! I spent some time there on vacation a few years ago. I loved that place! Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Chicken, potatoes, veg, 
I see. When I was young, my mom used to prepare various types of food. Now I try to have light and healthy dinners with lots of vegetables. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
hungry
I'm hungry too! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
healthy
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
i have time
Great! I love spending time cooking myself. That's one of my hobbies. What about Simple Herb Crusted Salmon? It contains salmon fillets, which seems perfect for you!
looks good
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
yes
 Maple Glazed Salmon has maple syrup in it, hopefully you will like it.

I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?

 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
