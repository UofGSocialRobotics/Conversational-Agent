Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Kari
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm good
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
in Finland
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
It depends. Mostly healthy food
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Maybe something
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Healthy if possible
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nothing
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Yes I have time to make something
Great! Carrot Cake Smoothie has carrot in it, hopefully you will like it.
Hello
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
