Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
My name is Pawel
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, everything's great!
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
In Poland, in a fairly large city
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
pasta, chicken, vegetables, juices
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm a bit hungry, but I'd prefer a light dinner.
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
I'd love to eat something healthy.
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Rather, something quick to prepare.
Of course, you're a busy person.  Poached Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
really great proposition, i was even thinking about the fish dish
Okay. What about Simple Herb Crusted Salmon? It contains salmon fillets, which seems perfect for you!
Another great idea, I'm really getting hungry.
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
