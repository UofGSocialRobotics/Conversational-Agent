Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Morgan
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I’m alright thank you, yourself?
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Dundee
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
I usually don’t cook often but I eat chips, chicken breasts, tikka masala and cottage pie.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I’m not too hungry.
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Fairly
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
None at all.
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick 
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like kale, how about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad?
I don’t like kale 
I can recommend something else. What about Sauteed Spinach with Bacon and Onions? It contains baby spinach, which seems perfect for you!
I don’t really like spinach
Give me another chance. Avocado With Bell Pepper And Tomatoes has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
I don’t like avacado either haha 
Let me find something else. If you like red peppers, how about Chickpea Salad With Roasted Red Peppers?
I more than likely would not eat any of those.
I have something else for you. Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper has broccoli in it, hopefully you will like it.
No thank you.
I can't find anything else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
