 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?

Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?

Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?

Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Chicken and veggies
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
sorta
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like kale, how about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad?

I can recommend something else. What about Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!

Okay. If you like baby spinach, how about Sauteed Spinach with Bacon and Onions?

Okay. Would you like another recipe?
