hello cora
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
C
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Im doing good, everything is great and yourself?
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in the UK
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Pizza, lasagne, pasta, roast dinner, fish and chips, Chinese food, curry. 
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
not too unhealthy but not super healthy either in the middle!
Ya, taste first and healthiness second right?  Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
none 
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick!
Of course, you're a busy person.  Herring Fish Cakes with Fresh Dill has breadcrumbs in it, hopefully you will like it.
thanks for the recommendation 
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
yes please
 Greek Salad Wrap has greek olives in it, hopefully you will like it.
cool
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
