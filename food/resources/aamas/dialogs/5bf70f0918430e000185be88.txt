Hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I've been built by a team of researchers to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Paulo
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes. Thanks
Lovely! As a computer program, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. My programmers would like to know you a bit better. I was created in Glasgow, United Kindgom. Can you tell me where you live?
Porto, Portugal
I see. Sometimes, my programmers go there. I see that Wikipedia says nice things about it. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Meat 
I see. I used to eat lots of CDs and DVDs back in the days, but I only get USB sticks once in a while now. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Hungry
I don't know what it feels like to be hungry, but I'll remember to find something filling for you! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
I have no preference
Ya, taste first right? I have never had any food, but humans seem to get so much pleasure eating, I hope someday I can experience it. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time to cook tonight
Great! I have to admit that I spend most of my time doing complex calculations and improving my english skills. Butternut Squash Soup has butternut squash in it, hopefully you will like it.
Thanks
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
Yes
 Creamy Broccoli Spinach Soup | A Bowl of Green has broccoli in it, hopefully you will like it.
Thanks
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
No
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
