Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?

Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
all sorts it changes everyday...
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?

Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  Creamy Broccoli-white Bean Soup has broccoli in it, hopefully you will like it.
thank you
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
no
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
