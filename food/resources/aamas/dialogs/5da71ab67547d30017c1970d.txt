hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Tiago
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
London
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Pasta with meat
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Meet*
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Average
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Not really
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  Quick black bean dip has black beans in it, hopefully you will like it.
Hello
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes
 What about Tuna & White Bean Salad? It contains water-packed tuna, which seems perfect for you!
Thanks!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
