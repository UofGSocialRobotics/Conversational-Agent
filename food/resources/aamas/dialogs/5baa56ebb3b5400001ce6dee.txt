Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Lesly
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
fine
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?

Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
chicken
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
moderately 
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I dont like tomatoes
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time to cook
Great! If you like black quinoa, how about Quinoa Salad with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Kale, Dried Cranberries, & Red Onion?
No too healthy
I have something else for you. Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
I dont like kale
I have something else for you. What about Baked Snapper with Harissa, New Potatoes, and Spring Onions? It contains snapper fillets, which seems perfect for you!
I would eat this
Okay. Would you like another recipe?

 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
