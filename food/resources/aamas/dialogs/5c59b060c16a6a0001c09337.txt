Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Miguel
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm alright, thank you. How are you? 
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
Portugal
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Chicken breast salad
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
A light dinner please
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
A little
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
I don't have kale at home
I have something else for you. Sauteed Spinach with Bacon and Onions has baby spinach in it, hopefully you will like it.
I don't like bacon. 
Give me another chance. Avocado With Bell Pepper And Tomatoes has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
That looks good
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes, show me another
 Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper has broccoli in it, hopefully you will like it.
No, ginger is not my thing
Give me another chance. Sweet and Tangy Tuna Stuffed Peppers has light tuna in it, hopefully you will like it.
I like it
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
