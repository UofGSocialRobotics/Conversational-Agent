 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?

Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?

Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?

Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?

Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?

Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
