Hello Cora
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
John
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Everything is fine thanks. How are you?
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
In Lincolnshire, England.
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Something cooked from scratch. For example, chilli or shepherds pie.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Average.
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick.
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like great northern beans, how about Italian Style Rice And Beans?
No thank you.
Give me another chance. Italian Rice has cooked rice in it, hopefully you will like it.
I haven't got any rice. Please can you suggest a pasta dish.
I can recommend something else. If you like garlic cloves, how about Creamy Broccoli-white Bean Soup?
No thank you.
I can recommend something else. If you like kale, how about African Kale & Yam Soup?
Could you suggest pasta?
Okay. 15-minute Miso Soup with Greens and Tofu has tofu in it, hopefully you will like it.
No thank you.
I can't find anything else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
