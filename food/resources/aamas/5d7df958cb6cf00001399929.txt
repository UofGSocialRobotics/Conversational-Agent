hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Krisz
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, thank you.
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I'm living in Hungary.
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Usually I eat some kind of meat for dinner.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'd have a light dinner, please.
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
It doesn't have to be heathy at all.
Ya, taste first and healthiness second right?  Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
There aren't any.
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I choose the quick dinner.
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
Sounds fine to me.
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes, of course.
 What about Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
It must be delicious!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Sure.
 If you like garlic clove, how about Tomato, Onion, Avocado Salad?
But I don't like garlic, sorry.
Let me find something else. If you like avocado, how about Massaged Kale Salad with Avocado and Pickled Red Onions?
I would eat it.
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No, thank you, I think these recipes are enough for one meal.
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
