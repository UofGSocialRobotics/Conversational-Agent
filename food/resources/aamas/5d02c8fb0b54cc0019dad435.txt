Hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I've been built by a team of researchers to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Ricardo
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm ok and you?
Lovely! As a computer program, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. My programmers would like to know you a bit better. I was created in Glasgow, United Kindgom. Can you tell me where you live?
Portugal
I see. Sometimes, my programmers go there. I see that Wikipedia says nice things about it. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Rice and meat
I see. I used to eat lots of CDs and DVDs back in the days, but I only get USB sticks once in a while now. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light dinner
Yeah. As a computer program, I am never hungry either. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Healthy enough
Ya, taste first right? I have never had any food, but humans seem to get so much pleasure eating, I hope someday I can experience it. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course. Main advantage of being a computer program: I have all the time in the world! If you like flatleaf parsley leaves, how about Grilled Squid Salad With Lemon, Capers, And Parsley?
Great!!
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
No, thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
