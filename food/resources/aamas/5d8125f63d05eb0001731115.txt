Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
My name's Daisy, hi
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yup, I'm excited
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I'm from England
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Egg or meat-based meals with vegetables
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
I want something with meat
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I don't like fish, spicy food or avocado
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time to cook
Great! What about Easy Kale & Broccoli Slaw Rice Bowl with a Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce â€¦and Fave Five Friday: Kale? It contains broccoli slaw, which seems perfect for you!
I can't tolerate spicy food, sorry
Let me find something else. Kale Fried Rice has cooked brown rice in it, hopefully you will like it.
That sounds great
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes please
 If you like cooked brown rice, how about Rice & Lentil Salad?
Sounds yummy
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No, this is fine, thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
