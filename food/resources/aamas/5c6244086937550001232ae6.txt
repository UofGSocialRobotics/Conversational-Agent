Hi
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Jeff
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
New Orleans, Louisiana
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Spaghetti 
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Very
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I don't eat pork
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
That looks delicious
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
