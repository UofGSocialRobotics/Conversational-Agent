Hello Cora
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
My name is Fabian
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I am somewhat tired
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll try to find something to cheer you up then! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Hamburg
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Pasta
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I am very hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Healthy
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
nope
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  Poached Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
Thank you!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes, please
 Simple Herb Crusted Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
Do you have a recipe without salmon?
Okay. If you like maple syrup, how about Maple Glazed Salmon?
Do you have a recipe with pasta?
Okay. What about Whole30 grilled salmon with avocado salsa? It contains avocado, which seems perfect for you!
Ok, thank you
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No, thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
