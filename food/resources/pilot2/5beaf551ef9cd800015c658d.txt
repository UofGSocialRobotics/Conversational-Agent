Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Mandee
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Fine thank you
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
Liverpool 
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Chicken rice and brocoli 
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Very healthy 
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Quick 
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like salmon fillets, how about Poached Salmon?
I don't like fish 
I have something else for you. What about Avocado chickpea salad (and a giveaway!)? It contains avocado, which seems perfect for you!
Don't like avacado 
I can recommend something else. If you like avocado, how about Chopped Kale Salad with Pomegranate & Avocado?
I don't like avacado 
I can recommend something else. If you like kale, how about Melt In Your Mouth Kale Salad?
No thank you
I can recommend something else. If you like lemon juice, how about Simple Massaged Kale Salad with Lemon Dressing?
I don't like kale 
I can't find anything else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
