Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Fred
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
working
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
anywhere
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
anything
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
reasonably
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
something quick to prepare
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
good
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
no
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
