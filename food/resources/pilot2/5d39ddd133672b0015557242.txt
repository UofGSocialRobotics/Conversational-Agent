Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
My name is Chris
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm good, thanks
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Poland
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
I usually cook vegetarian curry for dinner
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'd rather have a light dinner today
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Quite healthy, but also tasty
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I'd rather have something quick to prepare
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like broccoli, how about Easy Stir-Fry Broccoli and Red Bell Pepper?
I don't have broccoli at home. Can you suggest me something else?
I have something else for you. If you like baby spinach leaves, how about Mango Spinach Green Smoothie?
That sounds lovely
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes please
 What about Spinach Strawberry Salad with Strawberry Vinaigrette? It contains baby spinach, which seems perfect for you!
Sounds perfect! Thank you
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No, I think two recipes are enough for today
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
