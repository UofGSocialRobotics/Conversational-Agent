Hello Cora
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Ruth
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes good thanks!
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
Durham
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Stir fry, tofu, pasta
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light dinner
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Very 
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I'm vegan
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person.  If you like lime, how about Chipotle Lime Grilled Shrimp Salad in Cilantro Lime Dressing?
No, I don't eat fish
I can recommend something else. Unstuffed Paleo Cabbage Rolls has cabbage in it, hopefully you will like it.
Yes sounds good
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Yes please
 Avocado chickpea salad (and a giveaway!) has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
Yes I like that
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
