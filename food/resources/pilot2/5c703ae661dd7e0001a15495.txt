Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Emir
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yeah everything is perfect
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Germany
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
I usually eat meat with some salad, and maybe mashed potatoes on the side
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm not really hungry at the moment but I might be hungry in about half an hour
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Just a little bit
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nah
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I don't have much time
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
I don't really like avocado
I can recommend something else. What about Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
I don't want to eat onions since I have a meeting later and don't want my breath to smell like onions
I have something else for you. What about Fennel With Turnip Greens? It contains fennel bulb, which seems perfect for you!
That seems nice
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
Sure
 If you like chicken cutlets, how about Chicken With Fennel-orange Salad Recipe?
Maybe something without oranges`?
Okay. What about Seared Salmon with Oranges and Fennel? It contains fennel bulb, which seems perfect for you!
I don't want to eat oranges
I can't find anything else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
