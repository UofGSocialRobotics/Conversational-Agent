hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I've been built by a team of researchers to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Alex
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yeah, fine thanks, and you?
Lovely! As a computer program, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. My programmers would like to know you a bit better. I was created in Glasgow, United Kindgom. Can you tell me where you live?
Yorkshire.
I see. Sometimes, my programmers go there. I see that Wikipedia says nice things about it. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Various things
I see. I used to eat lots of CDs and DVDs back in the days, but I only get USB sticks once in a while now. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light dinner
Yeah. As a computer program, I am never hungry either. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Moderately
Being careful with what you put in your stomach right? I also try to be careful with the data I put in my Hard Drive. I got viruses twice, and I don't want that to happen again! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
None
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Have time
Great! I have to admit that I spend most of my time doing complex calculations and improving my english skills. Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
Ok
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
yeah
 Quinoa Salad with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Kale, Dried Cranberries, & Red Onion has black quinoa in it, hopefully you will like it.
ok
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
