Something quick
Sounds good
Yes please
Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Filip
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yeah, I'm alright.
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Poland
Delicious
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
No thanks
I usually eat schnitzels or sausages.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I am feeling hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Moderately
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Creamy Broccoli-white Bean Soup? It contains broccoli, which seems perfect for you!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
 What about African Kale & Yam Soup? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
