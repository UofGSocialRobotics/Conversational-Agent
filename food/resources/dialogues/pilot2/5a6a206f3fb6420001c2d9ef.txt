Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Leah
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, everything's fine.
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Zurich
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Something that involves rice or noodles
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm feeling quite hungry
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
As healthy as possible
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick would be nice
Of course, you're a busy person.  What about Poached Salmon? It contains salmon fillets, which seems perfect for you!
Great, thank you
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No thank you
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
