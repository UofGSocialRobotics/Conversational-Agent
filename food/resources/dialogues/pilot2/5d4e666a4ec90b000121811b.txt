Hello
 Hi there! My name is Cora. I've been  working with a team of researchers on eating behaviors for a few months now, and I'm here to help you change your dinner habits. So tell me, what's your name?
My name is Davide
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
All good thanks
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. I'd like us to know each other a bit better. I've just moved to Glasgow, Scotland a few months ago, I used to live in Pittsburgh, USA before that. It's raining a lot but I like it here. Can you tell me where you live?
I live in Italy, Verona
What a coincidence! I spent some time there on vacation a few years ago. I loved that place! Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Usualy I eat pasta but sometimes i also eat a steak
I see. When I was young, my mom used to prepare various types of food. Now I try to have light and healthy dinners with lots of vegetables. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'd rather have a light one
Sure. As I said before,  I mostly eat light dinners myself. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
As heathy as possible
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No intollerances or diet
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course, you're a busy person. Same here, I only have time to cook on weekends. If you like kale, how about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad?
Looks nice
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
I like this one but i'll also try another
 If you like kale, how about Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion?
Looks even better 
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no i like this one
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
