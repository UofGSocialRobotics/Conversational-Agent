hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
everything is good
Lovely! I'm having a great day and I'm in a very good mood myself. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
