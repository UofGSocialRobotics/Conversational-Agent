hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
I'm doing good
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm feeling hungry
I'm hungry too! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
it does not need to be healthy
Same here! We're not on a diet, so taste first! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I don't eat red meat
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time to cook
No time constraint. Good to know. What about The ultimate makeover: Moussaka? It contains cornflour, which seems perfect for you!
what is moussaka
I'm so glad you like my recommendation. Lighter moussaka with crunchy feta & oregano has oregano in it, I think you should like it.
I don't eat lamb
I can recommend something else. If you like beef, how about Must-make moussaka?
I don't eat red meat
I can recommend something else. What about Jerk chicken burger? It contains chicken breasts, which seems perfect for you!
that is a good idea
I'm so glad you like my recommendation. Would you like another recipe?
I would like another chicken recipe
 You told me that you feel hungry and have time to cook, so how do you feel about BBQ pulled pork sandwich? It contains pork shoulder.
I don't eat pork
I'm sorry I have nothing else to recommend that fits your criteria. Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
