hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes I'm doing good
Lovely! As a robot, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I'm hungry
I don't know what it feels like to be hungry, but I'll remember to find something filling for you! How healthy do you want your meal to be?
pretty healthy
Sure! For you humans, health is the real wealth, you're a smart person! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have time
Great! Robots like me can't cook, but it definitely seems fun to spend time cooking. What about Simple Herb Crusted Salmon? It contains salmon fillets, which seems perfect for you!
that sounds great
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
sure
 maple syrup would work perfectly for you if you feel hungry, want to eat healthy and have time to cook, so how about Maple Glazed Salmon?
looks nice
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
yes please
 salmon fillets would work perfectly for you if you feel hungry, want to eat healthy and have time to cook, so how about Salmon and Summer Veggies in Foil?
nice
My programmers will be happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
no thank you
 Enjoy your meal and see you soon!
