hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
feeling hungry
Same here! I'm starving... How healthy do you want your meal to be?
not so much healthy
Same here! We're not on a diet, so taste first! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick prepare
Of course, you're a busy person.  Chicken breasts would work perfectly for you if you feel hungry and don't have much time to cook, so how about Jerk chicken burger?
