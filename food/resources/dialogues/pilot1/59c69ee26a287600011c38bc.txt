hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yes, I'm doing wonderful. thanks for asking
Lovely! I'm glad to hear that. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I prefer a light dinner
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
fairly healthy
Sure! Health is the real wealth, you're a smart person! Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I do have time to cook tonight
No time constraint. Good to know. If you like baby spinach leaves, how about Mango Spinach Green Smoothie?
do you have some other suggestions
I can recommend something else. What about Creamy Broccoli Spinach Soup | A Bowl of Green? It contains broccoli, which seems perfect for you!
That appeal more to me, thank you
I can recommend something else. What about Spinach Pesto Quinoa Bowl? This meal contains baby spinach which is great if you want to eat healthy and have time to cook.
sounds delicious
I'm so glad you like my recommendation. Would you like another recipe?
