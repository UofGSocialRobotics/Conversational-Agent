hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
LZ
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yep, I'm good
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
Wisconsin
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Hamburger Helper
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Very hungry!
Let's get something to ease your hunger then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
Pretty healthy, but I still want it to taste good
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nope
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick, please!
Of course, you're a busy person.  Poached Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
Looks pretty good, minus the onion
Okay. Simple Herb Crusted Salmon has salmon fillets in it, hopefully you will like it.
I still don't like onions
Give me another chance. Maple Glazed Salmon has maple syrup in it, hopefully you will like it.
Syrup is a unique ingredient; that sounds good!
Okay. Baked Mustard-Crusted Salmon With Asparagus and Tarragon has asparagus in it, hopefully you will like it.
No, I want the maple-glazed salmon
Let me find something else. If you like great northern beans, how about Italian Style Rice And Beans?
That sounds good too
Okay. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
