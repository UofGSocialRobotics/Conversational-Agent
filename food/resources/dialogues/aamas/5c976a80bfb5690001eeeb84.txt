Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
I am George
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, absolutely.
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
In Patras, Greece.
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
I usually eat some fruits.
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
I prefer a light dinner.
Let's get something light then. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
so and so
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have plenty of time
Great! What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
Yes, I agree.
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
I would like also an alternative idea.
 If you like black quinoa, how about Quinoa Salad with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Kale, Dried Cranberries, & Red Onion?
It seems delicious!
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
No thanks!
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
