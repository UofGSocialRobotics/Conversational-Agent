Hi Cora
 Hi there! My name is Cora. I've been  working with a team of researchers on eating behaviors for a few months now, and I'm here to help you change your dinner habits. So tell me, what's your name?
Josh
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Nope
I'm sorry to hear that. Whenever I feel bad myself, I find comfort in a great dinner. I'd like us to know each other a bit better. I've just moved to Glasgow, Scotland a few months ago, I used to live in Pittsburgh, USA before that. It's raining a lot but I like it here. Can you tell me where you live?
The Moon
What a coincidence! I spent some time there on vacation a few years ago. I loved that place! Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
Some food
I see. When I was young, my mom used to prepare various types of food. Now I try to have light and healthy dinners with lots of vegetables. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
big big dinner
Sure. As I said before,  I mostly eat light dinners myself. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
-
Nice. I myself try to eat as healthy as I can. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No bloody kale
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Quick
Of course, you're a busy person. Same here, I only have time to cook on weekends. If you like black beans, how about Quick black bean dip?
No thanks
Okay, my mistake. But I have something else for you. What about Tuna & White Bean Salad? It contains water-packed tuna, which seems perfect for you!
Yes please
I'm happy you like it. Would you like another recipe?
Nope
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
