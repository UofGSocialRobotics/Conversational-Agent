hello
 Hi there! I'm Cora. I've been built by a team of researchers to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
kamil
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
yea 
Lovely! As a computer program, I don't have feelings, but it's great you feel good. My programmers would like to know you a bit better. I was created in Glasgow, United Kindgom. Can you tell me where you live?
Poland
I see. Sometimes, my programmers go there. I see that Wikipedia says nice things about it. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
meat
I see. I used to eat lots of CDs and DVDs back in the days, but I only get USB sticks once in a while now. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner
Yeah. As a computer program, I am never hungry either. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
i dont really care about that
Ya, taste first right? I have never had any food, but humans seem to get so much pleasure eating, I hope someday I can experience it. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
Nope
Noted. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Something quick
Of course. Main advantage of being a computer program: I have all the time in the world! What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
avocado
My programmers will be happy you like it. If you like kale, how about Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion?
cool 
My programmers will be happy you like it. Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
