Hi Cora, how are you? Would you like to know what you would like to have dinner today?
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So tell me, what's your name?
Nathalia
Nice to meet you. And how are you doing today? Is everything alright?
Yes, thanks
Lovely! I'd like to know you a bit better. Can you tell me where you live?
I'm living in Portugal
Good. Tell me. What do you usually eat for dinner?
 I usually make rice and beans with some protein
Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
 I would like a lighter dinner
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?
 slightly lighter with less saturated fat and less carbs
Okay. Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
It depends. Some days I don't work the night I can cook more elaborate foods, but some days I need to make faster foods
Great! Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
thanks Cora
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
i'd love it
 Quinoa Salad with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Kale, Dried Cranberries, & Red Onion has black quinoa in it, hopefully you will like it.
Perfect
Okay. Would you like another recipe?
