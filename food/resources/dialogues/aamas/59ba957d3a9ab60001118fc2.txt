Okay. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light
Something light for you, noted. How healthy do you want your meal to be?

Okay. We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
