Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
Light dinner please.
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
It doesn't have to be healthy.
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
No
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
Quick
 What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
Pass. I don't care for avocados or onions.
 If you like kale, how about Sweet Potato Kale Pizza with Rosemary & Red Onion?
Can I have something unhealthy please?
 Would you like another recipe?
Yes
 Sauteed Spinach with Bacon and Onions has baby spinach in it, hopefully you will like it.
Thanks
 Would you like another recipe?
No
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
