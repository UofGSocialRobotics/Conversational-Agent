Hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
just a little
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
I have lots of time
 What about Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad? It contains kale, which seems perfect for you!
Looks great, but I think I need a little meat also.
 Would you like another recipe?
yes
 What about Quinoa Salad with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Kale, Dried Cranberries, & Red Onion? It contains black quinoa, which seems perfect for you!

 Would you like another recipe?
