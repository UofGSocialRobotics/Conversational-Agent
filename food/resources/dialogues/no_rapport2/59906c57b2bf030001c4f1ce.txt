hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner please
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
not too healthy
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
I'm vegetarian
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
quick
 If you like lime, how about Chipotle Lime Grilled Shrimp Salad in Cilantro Lime Dressing?
I don't eat fish
 If you like cabbage, how about Unstuffed Paleo Cabbage Rolls?
I like cabbage but the instructions for that dish mentions sausages - I don't eat meat
 Avocado chickpea salad (and a giveaway!) has avocado in it, hopefully you will like it.
that's ok
 Would you like another recipe?
no thanks
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
