hello
 Hi there! I'm here to help you change your dinner habits and maybe find some new recipes for you to cook. So before I recommend something let me ask you a few more questions. First things first: are you feeling hungry or would you rather have a light dinner?
light dinner
 How healthy do you want your meal to be?
moderately
 Any specific diet or intolerances I should be aware of?
no dairy and no sulfites
 We're almost there. Would you have some time to cook tonight or would you rather have something quick to prepare?
i have time
 Avocado, Tomato, Kale & Onion Salad has kale in it, hopefully you will like it.
I can't eat kale or onions
 What about Quinoa Salad with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Kale, Dried Cranberries, & Red Onion? It contains black quinoa, which seems perfect for you!
I can't eat kale, onions or cranberries
 What about Baked Snapper with Harissa, New Potatoes, and Spring Onions? It contains snapper fillets, which seems perfect for you!
this will work, I'll just leave out the oninos
 Would you like another recipe?
no thank you
 Enjoy whatever you end up cooking and see you soon!
